# 2001_dimensions

#### K-means clustering procedure in 2001 dimensions (not just 2)

Dimensionality Reduction:
1. Python function that uses singular value decomposition to find the principal components of the data set.
2. Plotting of 200 cells in 2D expression space using their projections onto the first two principal axes.
3. Reconstruction of the original data set using only the projected data and eigenvectors for the first 2 principal components. 
4. Visualizion of the data using a heat map.
