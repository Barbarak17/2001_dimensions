# 2001_dimensions

Modify a K-means clustering procedure  so that it works in 2001 dimensions, not just 2.

Reduce the dimensionality:
* 1. Python function that uses singular value decomposition to find the principal components of the data set.
Plot of all 200 cells in 2D expression space using their projections onto the first two principal axes.
Plot of the data in 2D principal component space. 
Reeconstruct the expression patterns:
Reconstruction of the original data set using only the projected data and eigenvectors for the first 2 principal components. 
Visualizion of the data using a heat map.
